# Chilli Rants | When killing is preferable to loving who you are inclined to love

When did it become more acceptable to behead people, rape and enslave women and kill innocents than for two men to kiss and hold hands? At one point did men become so threatened by this that they chose this path of violence to make a stand against it?

Religious doctrine is used to influence in good ways and in evil ways, but at the end of the day religion is being used in ways that I am not fond of anymore and while I was at my worst, ambivalent about it, these days I am more inclined to turning my back on it all together. I am thoughtful and conscientious, often to a fault. I do believe in values, morals and above all else, kindness and empathy to my fellow man, but from here on out I believe it's time to eschew religious doctrine as a protest against the sickness it is inflicting on the world.

I blogged about Orlando earlier, but what I had really come to blog about was the man with the gun who caused this senseless violence. I am furiously pondering that rat bastard.

What drove him to this? What drives anyone to kill themselves or others? Greed or desperation but what was happening inside this fellow that made him finally erupt in this manner?

This made me think to a few years back when I worked with a man who committed suicide. We found out that he had ended his own life instead of admitting to his family and close knit community that he was gay. It was so painful knowing after the fact that he was so alone and depressed that killing himself was the easier path for this gentle man and that he felt worthless as a human simply because he was attracted to other men. He was kind, a wonderful person, well liked in his community and a hard worker. People loved him. He was making a difference in the world. He couldn't see is and his plight made me think about how culture enforces it's values onto us and what happens to us mentally when those same values collide with our true natures, as does religion which often drives the culture itself.

I'm so curious about this non-religious American person (memo to Donald Trump: he was one of your own). This man was either mentally unstable or a psychopath, with his past history of violence it is hard to guess what they will surmise, but I do wonder if he was struggling with his own latent homosexuality in a community where people are killed for being gay and if his self hatred fed his violent behaviours. Being gay is not what is shameful, but people isolating people for loving the same sex is. How can anyone be brainwashed to believe it is more shameful to be gay than murder innocent people? How does this become justifiable?

Over the next bit, I wonder what we'll find out as the media begins to ferret out their information. In my opinion, it's not about Muslims or religion per se, it is about intolerance bred into cultural norms and people's true natures colliding with the values enforced upon them and that is what should be rejected, religion based or not.
