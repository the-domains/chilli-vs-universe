# Happy Birthday is a touchstone for the suicidal

I'm a jerk who talks about all the things and I have been very open in my blog, social media and past podcast about suicide and how it touched my life. I am passionate about intervention and not just when someone is on their knees ready to give in, but the small things we can do daily for one another to show kindness and that we care, that people in our lives matter. I haven't had suicidal thoughts for a long time, but if you are -- read this. 

I'm a jerk who talks about all the things and I have been very open in my blog, social media and past podcast about suicide and how it touched my life. I am passionate about intervention and not just when someone is on their knees ready to give in, but the small things we can do daily for one another to show kindness and that we care, that people in our lives matter. I haven't had suicidal thoughts for a long time, but if you are -- read this.   
  
Ever since I finally stepped out of that black hole, I have made it a personal mission to look for opportunities to show care and to get balance in my life so I have greater capacity for kindness. Capacity = demonstration and that is how we put our money where our mouth is and walk our talk about every life having importance. It is also how we reinforce our values within ourselves.   
Sometime in 2013, after I left my marriage and my mom had passed away, something clicked in me: gratitude. I realized that people were why I had made it out of the dark days and back into the light. My connection to people was the anchor that held me here through those tumultuous years. That year in May, I made it a point to try to thank everyone who reaches out to say Happy Birthday and it had a profound impact on my thinking and how I felt about that milestone. When I say thank you, I am celebrating that I am still here to receive that wish, that I was a BAMF and chose to life over the easy way out. The path back is shitty, grinding, abrasive and filled with shards of glass, it's not for the faint of heart my adventurers, so when we make it through that effort deserves a kick-ass celebration and an anniversary to remind us that we are gloriously resilient mother fuckers. My day is my birthday and you didn't know it, but you were celebrating all that with me -so I thank you.   
My friends, loved one and acquaintances who have been here with me, you know what I am saying.You know how disconnected you feel from life and that weightless feeling like you could leave and no one would care, that everyone's lives would be better. That's depression, whispering lies to us and it's not real. It matters, it matters to me on a personal level if you go, because we are all in this together, adding value to one another's lives through small or large efforts every damn day.   
As we fight for survival, we become gladiators, flinging off the things that want to crush us and kill us. We become acutely aware of how important it is to reinforce positive moments on our brain. We learn to weed out the negative and continuously groom our experience so we don't go backwards. We become owners and accountable to what's happening in our experience. We are the empowered, and if truth be told, we're just a little godlike in the way we know that nothing can kill us that we have power over. 

For anyone that has not been suicidal, the brain's chemistry is absolutely fucked up at that moment. You cannot simply reason your way through it. Telling someone to snap out of it can help, but it's not realistic. Asking them to choose life and work with the people around them to make things better so they want to be involved in it again is much more tangable. It takes time and investment, but it works. When someone is depressed, they are not their true selves. Thoughts are often incoherent but oddly at that moment, we think they make sense. It's quite like being poisoned really.   
When you're really in the thick of it, everything just takes so much goddamn effort, even brushing your teeth and when people can't even follow their routine anymore, that's when people in our lives are really in danger. It's insidious the way it comes on, it can be so gradual that no one even notices it's happening until the deterioration and debilitation have gone too far and suddenly you can't even tread water. The people around us often don't even know, because we don't know better and we mask the symptoms. One thing we can do in our step to choose life is to be honest with those around us who we trust. Holy game changer. The years I was suicidal, no one knew until I told them. I was too smart for that, they thought. I had a happy life they thought. Well, I am a survivor above all things and growing up with addicts, I learned to mask at a young age. And depression is a bastard, like cancer it is not very selective in who is chooses. We are all potentially it's little bitch.   
So this is my birthday wish, give people a hearty happy birthday on that day and if you are so inclined, tell them what they mean to you.   
Birthdays are for making good memories. I don't like gifts and I prefer these memories to hold with me because I can reflect on them to tell my brain, in any funky state it gets into, that we made the right choice all those times. You might not know the people around you that are struggling, but my challenge to you is to show your care and take time to tell people them that they do; that you respect and value them.   
Yeah, some of you are fickle hard asses that struggle to show it, I was you once. But now that I have shed that BS and I am not embarrassed to just let it out, I am happier. So tell people in your own badass way, but just fucking do it. You would be amazed at how big the smallest gesture can be when someone is just hanging on by a thread. That could be the day they are at their limit. I can only tell you that that moment happened to me countless times and I never told the people that they had saved my life in those moments. 

We never know what people are carrying around with them, weighing them down affecting their actions. Depression is telling them that they won't be missed and they are the sum of the negative experiences and thoughts in their lives. We have to fight that by shining a light on their goodness and value.   
If you are like me and you know this pain and the joy of wanting to live again, maybe you will join me in my mission. If you're not with the rest of us quite yet, don't underestimate the power of looking for the goodness in life -- kick your brain in the nards by calling it out it out in others and you will see that reflected back to you. When someone does something cool, acknowledge it. When you think of someone fondly or they impact your life or perspective in some positive way, stop what you are doing and tell them something that says: you are valued and I care that you are here.   
Thank you for adding value to my life. I'm grateful every day that I am here to finally be happy and be entrenched in the good stuff.   
Happy Birthday,   
Xoxo, Lisa
