      The Islamic State is no mere collection of psychopaths. It is a religious
      group with carefully considered beliefs, among them that it is a key agent
      of the coming apocalypse. Here's what that means for its strategy-and for
      how to stop it.

      ISTANBUL - On June 29, Turkey's 12th Gay Pride Parade was held on
      Istanbul's crowded Istiklal Avenue. Thousands marched joyfully carrying
      rainbow flags until the police began dispersing them with water cannons.

      Turks who don't fit into their vision of the ideal citizen.

  The Washington Post asked Muslims how the Orlando shooting affected them. Here
  are some of the responses: Simra Khan, 18 Surrey, England "The general debate
  has pitted Muslims and the LGBT community against one another, almost entirely
  erasing the existence of [LGBT and] Muslims. However, through discussion on
  social media, I have discovered more LGBT Muslim voices to connect with, and
  this has become even more of a reason to try and make ourselves visible.
