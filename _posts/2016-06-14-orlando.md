# Orlando.

I don't have anything really pithy to say about Florida man today. The worst mass shooting in America's history has taken place and this doesn't seem like the time or place. I feel numb, worried, angry and disconnected all at the same time over this latest mass shooting. This isn't just an American thing, we are all going through this instability in our world together and we are seeing a hero fall out of grace.

America was once the virtuous, the mighty and a force to be reckoned with. She knew her values and she protected her people at all costs. I'm not American, but I want to want to hold America up as my hero country again. I want to be able to speak about it's greatness. But those days are so long gone in many respects and I join the many who feel disillusioned and a real sense of loss.

What happened? Politics and agendas and it's sad that people can't come together on the things they do agree on to get things done. There no pride in that anymore, because at the end of the day, the lobbyists lead the way and you have to distance yourself from your opposition and stall their progress to get that all important edge. Do these people even know what they are posturing for anymore? It's sad and while I spent the first twenty years of my life dreaming about growing up and moving to America, that thought is so far from my mind today. Having said that, there are many Americans I would love to harbour in my own country to keep them safe.

So back to Florida. People are scared, they feel unsafe and the instability the political system is causing, the clash of messages, the perpetuation of hate is causing people to go off the rails. People are falling through the cracks as these rich political behemoths grind on each other for a sound bite a morsel of social media messaging that goes viral. You know what makes America great again? When you realize differences aside, you can still find your greatness and people take pride in the country again. When your would-be leaders stop selfishly basking in your downfall. When you convince your politicians that they need to start supporting action and change, even when it comes from the opposition, because stalling change is not progress and people suffering while a bunch of rich people go for weekends in the Hamptons is not acceptable.

When your country is unstable and the messages are bleak and dire, when leaders are mongering fear, you will conquer nothing. Your best leaders made each American look inside themselves and have the courage to fight against all odds. They didn't give you cause to deride your neighbours and spit on the people who clean your houses. They had ideals, values and vision that brought people together, gave you a cause and a sense of belief about your place in the world, no matter where you came from, that made you a force to be reckoned with.

Divided you are weak: ISIS is actively recruiting in every state in the U.S. daily, you have groups harassing Jewish Americans, persecuting them because of their religion and people are scared. Americans are uncertain and don't know where they fit in the world any more. The golden eagle is tarnished and the pride is fading fast and these hate groups are getting an in with your own people, born and bred Americans, after you have worked so hard for all this progress and fought all these wars to support your ideals and values. It doesn't have to be this way. You can focus on those similarities again, even if it's that ALL Americans deserve life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

The rest you can sort out at Sunday dinner.
