  Back in December, after the horrific ISIS-inspired shootings in San
  Bernardino, California that claimed 14 lives, Igor Volsky, Deputy Director,
  Center for American Progress Action Fund, brilliantly called out U.S.
  lawmakers' hypocritical reactions on Twitter. Volsky retweeted politicians who
  shared their "thoughts and prayers" for the victims by displaying the amount
  of money they received from the National Rifle Association (NRA).
