# Chilli Rants | You're out of pocket Stephen A. Smith - I'd choose Ayesha Curry

Recently Ayesha Curry took to Twitter in a rage against the NBA for what she perceived to be preferential treatment in favour of Lebron James against her husband, Steph Curry. In one move she seemed to have substantiated the conspiracy theorists that the NBA is rigged and validated it by seeing it with her own eyes. The public all groaned together thinking about the damage she'd just done to her husband, the current NBA golden child and the reaction ran the gauntlet from "girl, you need to sit down and know your role" to "she is just a strong opinionated woman defending her man."

To be honest, it made me throw up in my mouth a little bit. I don't know much about sports, but we can all agree that major athletes are brands and their ability to play at the top of their game is dependant on their pull to get themselves into the right team situation based not only on their talent, but on their marketability and reputation. It takes a lot of skill, hard work and a significant amount of luck to get the top of your game and be the asset that Curry has shown himself to be; it would be a shame to have anyone work that hard and have their partner murder their brand in one fell swoop. 

The husband reassured me that this would likely blow over fairly quick, he's followed sports his whole life and has more experience looking at these blow ups along the way, but over the course of our conversation I got to thinking that overcoming a bit of adversity might not be a terrible thing for Curry, who's touted to have a pretty pristine right up to this point in his career. It allows him to develop his leadership skills and show off that character that I've marveled at.

In my squad, I'm the Curry lover and my husband is totally \#TeamLebron, so I'm a bit defensive over my boy, I'll admit. In that moment of hearing his wife's tweets, I had true panic for Curry wondering how the NBA would react. This isn't the NHL, I overeacted, I know, but we are all taught not to bite the hand that feeds us and that just seemed a bit too edgy to not go unpunished - she went right for a punch in the D, hitting the NBA in the conspiracy theory. Ouch.

As a Curry fan, we are united and protectionist. He's our boy. We want him to fulfill the expectations we hold for our golden boy and surpass them. We don't want some hysterical person, from his camp no less, taking him down and muddying the waters. I'll admit, I was in that moment in the "girlfriend, sit down and shut your social media loving face" camp. 

This is all based on personal lens, in my mind, couples keep that talk between them and jointly decide how to annihilate the outside threats - or even determine if there is one. I'm territorial, protective and jealous to a fault, I come with more than a dash of "feisty bitch bonus flavouring," so I do get Ayesha Curry and understand in that moment where her partner was wronged and his reputation was at stake - she wanted to smite the powers that be. While I get it, I also don't believe that she should have acted on it. The stakes were too high and she added burden to her partner's shoulders when he didn't need the distraction. But that's just my personal opinion, I'm not purporting it to be a fact _(looking at you here, Stephen A.)._

But then I wake up to [Stephen A. calling Ayesha out][0], essentially taking my initial thoughts and expanding on them a bit at first, but I was feeling his vibe here:

And then this here is the corner he lost me at. Suddenly I as back at "WTFF Stephen A.?" If this is his attempt to not sound inappropriate, I would have to wonder if he understands the meaning of appropriate. He's not even trying here and rather than defending it, he should just admit that his ego took the wheel on this one.

I enjoy his shocking generalizations, even the eye rolling I get to do on the occasions I listen to him. The controversial nature of the things that he says is amusing and part of me likes talking smack back to the radio, even though he can't hear it, I kinda thought that was the majority of us, but perhaps not. These sweeping statements are way too over the top to ignore, they are just more obnoxious worthy than an eye roll, they made me rant .

He's not a pacifist, he's authentic, I appreciate that. He gives me a different perspective that challenges my own and there's often some but of truth behind his words, sometimes a smidgen, other times a lot. It's the misogynistic icing on this one that makes me want to throw up in his lap though and I can't just shrug it off this round. Stephen A. Smith made me rethink everything and in the end, I have to totally go Ayesha Curry all the way.

I have landed on this topic this way: at the end of the day, it matters what Steph Curry thinks and he chose this media savvy, feisty, opinionated woman as his wife. He has defended her and stated that he understands her rage on his behalf in the situation, which just made my heart beat harder for him. Being an often opinionated loud mouth myself, I know my partner often has to shrug it off and that he accepts me as I am (love you babe!) and at the end of the damn day - don't we all want the people in our camp to be 100% on our side and protecting our back always and full tilt? Who doesn't want that in their partner?! I'm not "any man, or particularly a black man" but as a woman I can say single me, 25% black me would marry Ayesha in a heartbeat. She's got soul, she's an individual, she's ambitious, she seems joyful, she protects and defends her family like a she-cat and she wants to be more than someone's eye candy - she's out there embracing life and being her authentic self. Goddamn straight I'd pick that women. 

At the end of the day, Ayesha wasn't thinking about the money or the brand - in that moment she was team Curry and man, girlfriend was all in. That's some strong love right there. You do your thing from here on out Ayesha. I'm one more person that has your back.
